# MSFS_sitl_roll_controller




This is the source Simulink file that I used in the Youtube tutorial. 
This basic demonstration helps you setup your simulnik and simconnect SDK so you can communicate in real-time with Flight Simulator. 
The example provided is  implementing a roll controller using a simple PID block in discrete time.
Youtube Video Guide for setting up and run this simulation:

Important:

You need to install simconnect Toolblox from github.. (https://github.com/aguther/simconnect-toolbox)
and copy this file to the folder containing simconnect toolbox files.
I have already covered the installation and setup steps in this video tutorial:
